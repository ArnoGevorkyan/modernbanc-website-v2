### Merchant Microloans

Modernbanc makes it easy for any company to be a fintech company.

At present, e-commerce sites use third-party lending services to finance some of their more expensive products. This allows users to pay for a product over months instead of all at once. With Modernbanc, anyone can build out their own lending service without the need for a third-party or their fees.

### How it Works

Steps:

1. Create MDB workflow
2. Link Merchant Bank account
3. Link trigger to begin steps with necessary data: product price, number of months, buyer payment type, and interest rate if any
4. Create an account to track the amount of the item that is paid off over time
5. define a step to issue a payout at the end of each payment period
6. Each payment period, Modernbanc queries the payment provider and initiates a payment transaction
7. The resulting balance is shown until completion
