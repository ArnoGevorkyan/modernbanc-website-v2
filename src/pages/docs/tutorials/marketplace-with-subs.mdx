### Marketplace with Subscriptions (maybe rename to Recurring Payments)

This tutorial builds off a previous tutorial concept: [Marketplace](docs-modernbanc.vercel/docs/tutorials/marketplace)

In this tutorial, we will be adding subscriptions to the marketplace. This will allow users to subscribe to a product and get charged on a recurring basis.

Say you notice a problem in your local town. There's not enough on street parking for everyone. People park in places they shouldn't, resulting in parking tickets with heavy fines. However, you notice that there a lot of empty driveways and privately owned building parking lots. A marketplace to allow people with parking space they don't use to sell their space to people who need it sounds like a solution that benefits everyone. For this, we need all sorts of complex functions.We need to keep track of spot owner account balances, recurring payments for monthly or yearly rentals, transferring payments between parties, paying to or from users bank accounts, and taking a platform fee.

With Modernbanc, these complex money movements are simple. This is how it works.
