### Multiple Payment Types

---

Modernbanc makes it easy to support as many payment types as you want. Research shows that users who are able to use their preferred type of payment at the point-of-sale are as much as twice as likely to complete a purchase.

High level steps to integrate multiple payments providers in your app:

1. Create a **workflow** to run the logic to handle the **transactions** information, payment type in ****\*\*****units****\*\*****, and **triggers** to determine if payment went through
2. create **entities** to link buyer and merchant accounts using **********\*\***********connections**********\*\***********
3. Setup **connections** for each payment type
4. Handle taking input for the purchase: purchase amount, currency, and preferred payment
