### Intro to Modernbanc

As part of your application, there are certain financial interactions that need to happen. To integrate with your Modernbanc workspace, all you have to do is setup a workflow. In the workflow there are triggers and steps. Triggers determine when to do something, steps determine what to do. Let's say your user wants to pay for something using their bank account. They press the button in your app which triggers Modernbanc's API. Using the banks webhooks, Modernbanc initiates the transaction, and accounts for where it's going and the status of each step along the way.

Now that we have an understanding of how Modernbanc can help us quickly build complex financial movements, let's take an example.

### Marketplaces

Marketplaces are a key aspect of the digital economy. Think about companies like Airbnb, Uber, and eBay. These companies make our lives easier by connecting us to the people who provide the services or products we need as we go about our lives. One of the most difficult parts of building these applications, is dealing with all different types of complex accounting and transactions. That's where Modernbanc comes in. Let's take an example. Say we want to build a service that matches dogs breeders with people that want to get a dog. Breeders post their puppies, users can buy them, the company handles transportation. To do this, we need need a few key things to occur.

- Breeder account balances
- Breeder withdraw to bank account
- User payment from bank account, paypal, credit, or debit card
- Platform fee for services rendered

### How to use Modernbanc to Enable Financial Transactions

Modernbanc enables you to these complex sensitive financial interactions with ease.

Steps to Enable this in Modernbanc in the context of our dog breeder app:
<br />

<Process title="Login, Join Workspace" index={1}>

</Process>

<Process title="Select environment" index={2}>

- Currently, Modernbanc gives you 'test' and 'live' environments
- Test is for development and testing
- Live is for production apps with actual end users
- Environment needs to be defined in your request 'x-environment' header to either 'test' or 'live'

</Process>

<Process title="Login to get bearer auth">
  - Since the UI isn't launched yet, we will use postman or curl for this tutorial
  - Login to your Modernbanc account

    }'
    ```

</Process>
