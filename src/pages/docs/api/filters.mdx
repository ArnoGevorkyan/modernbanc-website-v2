# Filters

You can filter the results for all **GET** multiple objects endpoints via `where` query parameter.
This makes it easy to retrieve specific information, like any accounts assigned to a particular entity,
or all transactions completed after a given date.

For example, to return all transactions for a certain account you can use the following query:

```shell
GET /transactions?where={account_id:"some_random_id1"}
```

As you noticed in above example, we accept `where` params as JSON, however you
don't have to wrap it in top-level brackets and can do simpler queries like this.

```shell
GET /transactions?where=account_id:"some_random_id1"
```

Filtering works the same way on all properties of all objects and below are the available comparators for different types:

<Table inner_border="all" outer_border={true} responsive_cell>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property type</th>
      <th>Available comparators</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr key="0">
      <td>String</td>
      <td>`eq` (equals to X), `in` (equals to one of the strings in array X)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr key="1">
      <td>Number</td>
      <td>`eq` (equals to X)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr key="1">
      <td>Enum</td>
      <td>`eq` (equals to X)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr key="2">
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>`eq` (equals to X)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

You can filter by more than one property at once, e.g:

```json showLineNumbers
GET /transactions?
where={
  account_id: "some_random_id1",
  entity_id: "some_other_id"
}
```

By default all properties at the same level are part of the same `AND` logical group.

But you can combine filters into more complex ones with `AND` and `OR` operators.

```json showLineNumbers
GET /transactions?
where={
  OR: [
    {
      account_id: "some_random_id1",
    },
    {
      entity_id: "some_random_id2",
      route_id: "some_random_id3",
    }
  ]
}
```
