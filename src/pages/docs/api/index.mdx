# API Basics

Modernbanc API is located at `api.modernbanc.com/v1/`.

It offers **simplicity of REST** while offerring benefits you'd expect from GraphQL:

- All get multiple objects endpoints support [pagination](/pagination) and [filters](/filters)
- For all get endpoints you can [include](/include) only the fields you want.
- You can ensure one operation never runs twice **(important for payments!)** by using [idempotency keys](/idempotency).

#### Headers

For all workspace-related endpoints please attach `x-workspace` header with `identifier` field of your workspace.

For objects that support environments (have `environment_id` in them) also make sure to attach environment identifier in `x-environment` header.

For example to list accounts in test environment you'd send a request like below:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.modernbanc.com/v1/accounts'
  -H 'Authorization: ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY'
  -H "x-workspace: acme"
  -H "x-environment: test"
```
