# Include

For all **GET** endpoints you can include only the properties you want via the `include` parameter.

You can do it two ways:

- **Include** approach - include everything except chosen properties.
- **Exclude** approach - exclude everything except chosen properties.

#### General rules

By default for every object (including relations) you'll get all primitive properties. By primitive properties we mean all non-relation properties such as `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `jsonb` and `date` properties. For example: `account_id` (string) is included, while `account` (relation) is not.

```json
GET /balances/{id}
Result
{
  "id": "1f770c58-2393-4b49-bfb6-43f3766cb066",
  "identifier": "a",
  "name": "Main balance",
  "description": "This is the main balance of the account",
  "account_id": "c2b81c5a-1f18-4f5d-bdc0-85a64dd8d79d",
  "unit_id": "51edd301-761b-4561-a8a9-b61a627c387b",
  "type" : "main",
  "balance": "52.00",
  "available_balance": "52.00",
  "negative_balance": "52.00",
  "external_id": null,
  "variables" : null,
  "created_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
  "archived_at": null
}
```

Note that **include syntax doesn't affect** `id` - it is always included.

#### Include approach

As with [filters](docs/workspace/filters), `include` follows JSON format. To include only `name` of the Balance do following.

```json
GET /balances/{id}?include={"name":true}
Result
{
  "id" : "6b91f9fc-2f0d-4bdb-86c8-f41bab748d49",
  "name": "Main balance"
}
```

It's the same to include related objects. Note that defaults will apply for that object. (i.e all primitives included by default) For example to also include Unit:

```json
GET /balances?include={"name":true, "unit": true }
Result
{
  "id" : "6b91f9fc-2f0d-4bdb-86c8-f41bab748d49",
  "name": "Main balance",
  "unit" : {
    "id" : "245088c9-ff7c-4b26-b4ae-6d512c01498c",
    "name": "USD",
    "description" : "United States Dollar",
    "max_precision" : 2,
    "default_precision" : 2,
    "default_mode" : "floats",
    "workspace_id": "0b6496ce-fd62-4831-9c9f-341143b021ac",
    "background_color" : "#F0F0F0",
    "color" : "#49678D",
    "symbol" : "$",
    "created_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
    "archived_at": null
  }
}
```

```json
GET /balances?include={"name": true, "unit": { "name": true } }
Result
{
  "id" : "6b91f9fc-2f0d-4bdb-86c8-f41bab748d49",
  "name": "Main balance",
  "unit" : {
    "id" : "245088c9-ff7c-4b26-b4ae-6d512c01498c",
    "name": "USD"
  }
}
```

And again like with filters we accept relaxed JSON so you can drop top-level `{` `}` brackets or not use quotes in JSON keys.

For example this will also work.

```shell
GET /transactions?include=status:true
```

#### Exclude approach.

To include everything except `name` of the Balance do following:

```json
GET /balances/{id}?include{"name":false}
Result
{
  "id": "1f770c58-2393-4b49-bfb6-43f3766cb066",
  "identifier": "a",
  "description": "This is the main balance of the account",
  "account_id": "c2b81c5a-1f18-4f5d-bdc0-85a64dd8d79d",
  "unit_id": "51edd301-761b-4561-a8a9-b61a627c387b",
  "type" : "main",
  "balance": "52.00",
  "available_balance": "52.00",
  "negative_balance": "52.00",
  "external_id": null,
  "variables" : null,
  "created_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
  "archived_at": null
}
```

Same applies to related objects for example to also include Unit:

```json
GET /balances/{id}?include{"name":false,"unit":{"name": false}}
Result
{
  "id": "1f770c58-2393-4b49-bfb6-43f3766cb066",
  "identifier": "a",
  "description": "This is the main balance of the account",
  "account_id": "c2b81c5a-1f18-4f5d-bdc0-85a64dd8d79d",
  "unit_id": "51edd301-761b-4561-a8a9-b61a627c387b",
  "type" : "main",
  "balance": "52.00",
  "available_balance": "52.00",
  "negative_balance": "52.00",
  "external_id": null,
  "variables" : null,
  "created_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
  "archived_at": null,
  "unit" : {
    "id" : "245088c9-ff7c-4b26-b4ae-6d512c01498c",
    "description" : "United States Dollar",
    "max_precision" : 2,
    "default_precision" : 2,
    "default_mode" : "floats",
    "workspace_id": "0b6496ce-fd62-4831-9c9f-341143b021ac",
    "background_color" : "#F0F0F0",
    "color" : "#49678D",
    "symbol" : "$",
    "created_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
    "archived_at": null
  }
}
```

#### Restrictions:

You cannot combine **Include** and **Exclude** approach for primitives on same level. However you can use them together on different levels.

For example this is **not allowed**:

```json
GET /balances/{id}?include={"name": true, "description": false}
```

While this **is allowed**:

```json
GET /balances/{id}?include={"name": true, "unit": {"name": false}}
```

And this **is allowed** (include all primitives except `name` and include relation `unit`:

```json
GET /balances/{id}?include={"name": false, "unit": true}
```

#### Exceptions:

Some properties that look primitive are actually computed and are not included by default.

An example of computed property is `identifier` (string) in **Account**,
we don't store it in our database but auto-generate it from `identifier_prefix + '-' + identifier_value{:js}`.

So to include `identifier` alongside with default properties you'd have to explicitly specify `include={"identifier": true}{:json}`.
