# Idempotency

Modernbanc supports idempotency on its API calls, allowing you to safely
retry requests without worrying about accidentally duplicating them.

This is especially useful to avoid making the same payment twice, executing the same
workflow several times or double-counting money in case there are connectivity issues.

---

To make use of this feature, simply provide an `Idempotency-Key` header on your request,
which can be anything you choose but ideally a randomly-generated UUID.

Note to keep in mind when making idempotent requests:

- Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours.
- It is best practice to wait for a failure response from the POST call before attempting to retry the call.
