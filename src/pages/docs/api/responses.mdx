# Responses

Modernbanc uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests:

- `2XX` - indicates success.
- `4XX` - indicates an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was missing, frozen card, etc.).
- `5XX` - indicates an error with our servers.

<br />

#### Examples

<Tabs bordered padded={false} size="sm" background_color="#F6F6F6">

<Tab title="Success">
```json
{
  "result": ...data goes here,
  "pagination": "pagination data" // Optional
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Error">
```json
{
  "code": "ERR_UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "You have entered wrong details" 
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<br />

#### Exceptions

In some cases you'll get `200` responses while still having errors. For example with some endpoints like
create workflow we allow you to save your progress despite it not being valid. The response in those
situations will look like this.

```json
{
  "result": ...workflow,
  "errors": ["Variable X is invalid", "Amount can't be more than 100."]
}
```
