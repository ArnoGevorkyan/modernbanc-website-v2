# Background

In Modernbanc we support our own custom powerful formula language. Itâ€™s currently only used in workflows and later will be used across the whole app.

It aims to achieve 3 things:

- Be a read-only, secure and highly performant way of accessing/calculating data in Modernbanc.
- Have 90% resemblance with Excel to reduce the learning curve.
- Have shortcuts and natively support references to Modernbanc models (e.g accounts).

You typically can start writing formulas anywhere in the workflow by typing [[formula goes here]].

For example, when I want workflow to return the number that was provided by user and multiply it by 4.

```tsx
Return step:
{
    "code" : 200,
		"return" : "New value is [[_trigger_version._input.body*4]]"
}
```

#### Features

- Binary operators: `+` (plus), `-` (minus) `*` (multiply) `/` (divide).
- Object and member expressions similar to Javascript. E.g normal member expressions `account.balances` or computed member expressions `steps[3]` (by computed we mean you can put an expression e.g to access step 7 you can do `steps[3+4]`
- Objects and arrays.
- Coming soon: shortcut references to accounts and other models (e.g `#ACT-5.balance`)
