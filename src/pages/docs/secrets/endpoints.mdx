# Secrets.

Secrets are just like any other objects in your workspace. You can create, update and delete them.

<Schema style={{ marginTop: '8px', marginBottom: '20px' }} title="Secret" />

<Operation method="post" title="Create secret" path="/v1/secrets" />
<Operation method="put" title="Update secret" path="/v1/secrets/{id}" />
<Operation method="get" title="Get secret" path="/v1/secrets/{id}" />
<Operation method="get" title="List secrets" path="/v1/secrets" />
<Operation method="delete" title="Delete secret" path="/v1/secrets/{id}" />

### Creating secrets

To create one or more secret, send a POST request to `/secrets`. You must also provide `name` for this secret which can be anything you like for descriptive purposes.

You can also optionally provide a `deletion_date` for your secret, which is the date and time when your secret will be automatically deleted by Modernbanc.

**Request:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Card number",
    "value": "4242 4242 4242 4242",
    "deletion_date": "2023-01-13T18:44:11.263Z"
  }
]
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Card number",
    "value": "4242 4242 4242 4242",
    "deletion_date": "2023-01-13T18:44:11.263Z"
  }
]
```

### Updating secrets.

You can update your secret at any time whether it’s to change the underlying information that was stored or update its name.

**Updating name of the secret**

```json
{
  "name": "Card number",
  "value": "4242 4242 4242 4242"
}
```

**Updating underlying value of the secret**

```json
{
  "value": "4242 4242 4242 4242"
}
```

### Getting secrets.

To get or list your secrets just use the GET endpoints like any other objects. Standard include, pagination and filter rules apply.

Because field `value` is a computed field we don’t include it by default. So if you want to get the original value of your secret you need to explicitly specify `?include={value:true}`.

**Example without include value.**

```json
{
  "id": "ENCRYPTED_JAN23_lsYnrfANN9VsvQq40ex",
  "name": "Card number",
  "deletion_date": "2023-01-13T18:44:11.263Z"
}
```

**Example with include value.**

```json
{
  "id": "ENCRYPTED_JAN23_lsYnrfANN9VsvQq40ex",
  "name": "Card number",
  "value": "4242 4242 4242 4242",
  "deletion_date": "2023-01-13T18:44:11.263Z"
}
```

Also note that since `value` is a computed field you can’t currently filter on it.
