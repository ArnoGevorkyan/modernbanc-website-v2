# What is Modernbanc?

Modernbanc is an all-in-one financial, accounting and payments workspace that consists of three parts:

- **Accounting** - A full-featured accounting and financial database to act as internal source of truth for all your accounts and transactions.
- **Workflows** - Automate any accounting, payments and other processes with customizable workflows that consist of steps and triggers.
- **Secrets** - Encrypt, decrypt, collect, store and share any sensitive data including PII, payments or PCI card data.

#### What can I do with it?

You can use one or all of these features to do anything from bookkeeping, to managing payment flows. You can record your company's financial activity and accounts, track customer balances/accounts, intiate payments or reply to card authorizations. Modernbanc is a truly flexible tool.

Together all three enable you to solve infinitely complex problems, for example:

- **Managing company books and payments**. Use **accounting** and **workflows** as a programmatic alternative to Quickbooks to track and manage your company books with tight integration into payment providers.
- **Managing marketplaces**. Use **accounting** and **workflows** to complex payment flows and accounting for all involved parties.
- **Smart-checkout**. Use **encryption** to collect and **workflows** to forward card data to payment processors without ever touching it, therefore, staying outside of PCI scope. (Modernbanc is Tier 1 PCI Certified.). Add **accounting** to record and reconcile any purchases.
